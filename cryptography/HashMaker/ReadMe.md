# HashMaker
This can be used to create specialised hash functions for your data. Lets say you have a fixed data set and you need a small but reasonable hash function you can use HashMaker to identify one. HashMaker is using an evolutionary algorithm to create random functions where each genome can hold one or more operators that operate on a fixed size hash state.
