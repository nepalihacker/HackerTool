You won't need to compile the whole stuff by yourself. Just type 'make' in the
root directory of the package and you'll get the available make targets. Type:

        gmake -f Makefile.[put your OS here] ixkeylog

for compiling the main binary. Use

        gmake -f Makefile.[put your OS here] clean

to cleanup everything.
